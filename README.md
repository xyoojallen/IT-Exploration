# IT-Exploration

IT Exploration at Western Technical College served as a foundational course that immediately introduced me to the core principles of my program. The class emphasized hands-on learning, offering practical projects that reinforced theoretical concepts. We progressed efficiently from structured lessons, such as Cisco networking fundamentals, to broader assignments involving a variety of software, hardware setups, and programming languages.

I learned that GitHub and coding are really useful for working with data. GitHub helps you keep track of your stuff and work with other people without messing things up. Coding makes it faster to clean data and make charts. I didnâ€™t know how much easier these tools could make analyzing data. Using them will help me do my data work better and faster.
